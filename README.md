# UK-Used-Car-Price-Prediction

**1. Introduction**

***Dataset***

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains information of more than 15K Volkswagen used cars that were sold in July 2020 in the UK.

***Objective***

The objective of this project is to build a model to predict the used car price for personal or professional interests, based on the most significant features selected in the dataset.

**2. Techniques**

The car price prediction requires the regression supervised machine learning techniques among which I select the linear regression algorithm to train our model.
During the training process, we will also check the assumptions of OLS regression and evaluate the performance of the model.

Used libraries:

* pandas: data cleaning/transformation & data visualization
* statsmodels.api: modeling
* standardScaler: standardizing the dataset
* assumptions: built function to check linear assumptions of the model

**3. Outcomes**

After the training process, the model managed to predict the car price with an Adj R-squared of 90%.

Regarding linear assumption check, one assumption out of five is violated.

- validated assumptions: Linearity, Multicollinearity, Autocorrelation, Homoskedasticity of Error Terms,
- violated assumption: Normality

Explanation: The violation of normality assumption might be because there still are outliers even after dropping them twice. 

Solution: 
* Continue to handle outliers and remediate the violated normality, or
* Use other regression algorithms whose result is not impacted by the outliers such as Random forests, Decision Trees...
